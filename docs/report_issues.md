# Report an Issue

This page covers the basics to report an issue either to your instructor or using the built-in GitHub Issues tracker

When reporting an issue provide the following information.

- A brief description of the issue and how to reproduce it

- Section in lab or page you found the issue

- How you are running the tutorial? Cloud or on-premises

- Screenshots or code snippets if appropriate
  - Check how to [create and highlight code](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)

- Tools and OS versions if the issue is in a lab

  - `vitis -version`
  - `xbutil --version`
  - `lsb_release -a`
  - VCK5000 platform information

Report the issue to your instructor or open a [new issue](https://github.com/Xilinx/xup_aie_training/issues).
It is always a good idea to check previous issues in case that the issue has already been resolved.
